    <p>Goal:  To see if any number reaches the pattern 4, 2, 1.  The pattern is that the number is divided by 2 if even and multiplied by 3 and increased by 1 if odd.</p>
    <form id="form"><!--Had to use Chat GPT to figure this one out--apparently, submitting a form automatically refreshes the page.  However, since it is the easiest way to set data types, I will still use the form.-->
        <label for="number">Type the number you want to test:</label>
        <input type="number" id="input" name="number">
        <input type="submit" id="submit">
        <br>
        <p id="returnV"></p>
    </form>
    <p>Note:  This program will only run the pattern about 1,000 times.  Otherwise, the program may overload the computer.</p>
