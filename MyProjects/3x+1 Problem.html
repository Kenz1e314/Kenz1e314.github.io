    <p><b>WORK IN PROGRESS</b></p>
    <p>Goal:  To see if any number reaches the pattern 4, 2, 1.  The pattern is that the number is divided by 2 if even and multiplied by 3 and increased by 1 if odd.</p>
    <form id="form"><!--Had to use Chat GPT to figure this one out--apparently, submitting a form automatically refreshes the page.  However, since it is the easiest way to set data types, I will still use the form.-->
        <label for="number">Type the number you want to test:</label>
        <input type="number" id="input" name="number">
        <input type="submit" id="submit">
        <br>
        <p id="returnV"></p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Note:  Do NOT press the submit button without picking a number first.  Due to the nature of the while loop, it will cause the program to run indefinitely, which will make everything slow down and make it difficult to shut down the page.</b></p>
